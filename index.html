        <li><strong>1815:</strong> Ada Lovelace is born on December 10th in London, England as Augusta Ada Byron, the daughter of the famous poet Lord Byron and mathematician Annabella Milbanke.</li>
        <li><strong>1824:</strong> Ada's parents separate, and her mother encourages her to study mathematics and science to prevent her from inheriting her father's poetic tendencies.</li>
        <li><strong>1833:</strong> Ada meets Charles Babbage, the inventor of the Difference Engine, a machine designed to perform mathematical calculations. She becomes fascinated with his work and begins to collaborate with him on his next project, the Analytical Engine, a machine that could perform any kind of calculation.</li>
        <li><strong>1843:</strong> Ada translates an article on the Analytical Engine by Italian mathematician Luigi Menabrea from French to English. She adds her own extensive notes to the article, which end up being three times longer than the original. These notes, which describe how the Analytical Engine could be programmed to calculate a series of numbers known as the Bernoulli numbers, are now considered the first computer program ever written.</li>
        <li><strong>1980:</strong> The U.S. Department of Defense creates a programming language for the U.S. military, which they name "Ada" in honor of Ada Lovelace.</li>
        <li><strong>2009:</strong> Ada Lovelace Day is established, an annual event that celebrates the achievements of women in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields.</li>
